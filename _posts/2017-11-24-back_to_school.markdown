I am not a stranger to the tech world. I have a background in computer science and mathematics from many years ago. At the time of my studying web development was on the rise, however not really available in a university curriculum. And when I caught a glimpse of it, I was interested from the first sight. 

Then, life happened. I moved from Belarus to the United States, spend time settling in, getting a grip on the new country, new rules, new opportunities, new challenges. 

When I was ready to get back to the tech world, going back to college was not an option, I just couldn’t afford it. I wasn’t ready to give up though, my friend recommended me a school in Silicon Valley, they had remote QA course. By that time I heard about QA Analysts but didn’t know it’s a thing. It came naturally to me, I got hooked and completed the course successfully, Aaaand this is how my journey in tech companies started. I’ve been a QA Analyst for over 6 years.

Throughout these 6 years, I’ve been always hungry for more technical knowledge, taking various online courses here and there. To be honest, some of them didn’t get completed or once completed, I didn’t have the practice to apply them. Without practice, you quickly forget what you learned. Then you learn the same thing again. It’s a vicious circle... As you can imagine, it didn’t leave me satisfied. 

Finally, I decided to fully commit! This is how my Flatiron School journey begins.
