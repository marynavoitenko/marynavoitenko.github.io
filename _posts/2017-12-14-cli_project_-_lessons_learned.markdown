You got to the end of the section! Yay! Pat yourself on the back, you deserve it.
It’s time to build your first project from scratch...aaaaa….

Feeling super overwhelmed about starting a project from scratch, I thought I needed a fun theme to keep me motivated. Being a huge tennis fan, I chose to scrape [ATP World Tour](http://www.atpworldtour.com/). 

I had so much fun (most of the time lol) building it. Had many realizations where I should have done things differently, so I thought I’d share it with other students (or even with myself when I get to the 2nd portfolio project)

**Tips and Tricks:**

* Read through Requirements and Instructions. Take time reading through all of them. I am definitely guilty of not reading until the end, creating my repository too soon and missing few things. Boo :(
* So, you read through and it’s a lot of bullet points, so many tasks to complete. How to keep up?! Write them down. A piece of paper, Google doc, Trello, etc. whatever works best for you.

Feels good to move tasks to Done, right? 

* Commit early and often. Guilty. Didn’t read through carefully and definitely wasted my time. Another boo for me :(
* Use comments in the code. You could remove them before submitting your project but they are such huge help. Finishing for the night? Leave a note for yourself describing what are the next steps. Creating multiple new methods and planning to add code to them later? Add comments describing what those methods should do. 

Coding a project is like a rollercoaster. You’re feeling great, everything works, you know what to do => ugh I keep getting the same error, feeling annoyed and frustrated => feeling great => feeling not great, hating code => love code! A-ha moment! => etc. 

Sounds familiar? Keep reading.

**What to do when you feel stuck?**

* Take a break (take a walk, read a book, talk to a friend, have some tea, play video game, etc.)
* Watch another one of recorded OO videos from Flatiron library. You’ve already watched one and think it’s enough? Trust me, you’ll find something interesting and new in each one of them. 
* Read Learn Magazine (blogs of other students). I can’t stress enough how amazing it is, there is so much content available to you. So many students are going through the same struggles as you.

Good luck with your project! :-)
